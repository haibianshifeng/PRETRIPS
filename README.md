# PRETRIPS
Pore-scale reactive transport code in porous systems
Hi there,
This is an open source code for PRETRIPS to simmulate reactive transport in porous media. It is written in FORTRAN 90. The modules include fluid flow, solute transport, chemical reaction (fluid/solid and fluid/fluid reactions) and solid particle movement due to reaction. This code can be run in 2D and/or 3D. This is a framework but each module can also be run separately.
